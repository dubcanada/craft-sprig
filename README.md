# Sprig

### A reactive Twig component framework for Craft.

Sprig is a free plugin for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/) that allows you to create reactive components from Twig templates and/or PHP classes. These components can re-render themselves on user-triggered events (clicks, changes to input fields, form submissions) using AJAX requests, without requiring you to write a single line of JavaScript.

Entirely inspired by [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/). Built for Craft with a focus on developer experience and simplicity.
