# Sprig

### A reactive Twig component framework for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/).

Sprig is a free plugin for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/) that allows you to create reactive components from Twig templates and/or PHP classes. These components can re-render themselves on user-triggered events (clicks, changes to input fields, form submissions) using AJAX requests, without requiring you to write a single line of JavaScript.

It's basically [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) for Craft, with a focus on developer experience and simplicity.

> This plugin is currently in active development. Please contribute by reporting any bugs or issues.
