# Sprig

### A reactive Twig component framework for Craft.

Sprig is a free plugin for [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/) that allows you to create reactive components from Twig templates and/or PHP classes. These components can re-render themselves on user-triggered events (clicks, changes to input fields, form submissions, etc.) using AJAX requests, without requiring you to write a single line of JavaScript.

Inspired entirely by [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/), built specifically for Craft with a focus on developer experience and simplicity.

> Sprig is currently in beta. Please report any bugs or issues in [Github](https://github.com/putyourlightson/craft-sprig/issues).
